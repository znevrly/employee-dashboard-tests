UI/Application bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue: Dashboard UI is accessible without authentication
Description: Endpoints are protected but dashboard UI itself is not
Severity: critical
Steps to reproduce:
Go to https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits
Current behavior: UI dashboard is accessible (empty)
Expected behavior: UI dashboard is not accessible without authentication


Issue: Auth token is not refreshed and has short validity
Description: User is not able to perform any action if inactive for 20+ minutes
Severity: critical
Steps to reproduce:
Sign In
Do not perform any action for 20+ minutes
Reload page or perform any action
Current behavior: Auth token expired. User can't see employee list (endpoint protected) but there is only empty UI.  
Expected behavior: User is either still logged (token refreshed) until he/she signs out. Alternatively, user can be signed out but UI should redirect to Sign In page


Issue: Dashboard Columns Last Name and First Name are swapped
Severity: major
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in and observe Dashboard
Current behavior: In column Last name is employee First name and in column First name is employee Last name  
Expected behavior: In column Last name is employee Last name and in column First name is employee First name


Issue: Currency is missing
Severity: major
Description: Money values such as Salary, Gross Pay, Net Pay has no currency sign. 
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in to dashboard and see any employee record in list
Current behavior: No currency sign for money value
Expected behavior: Each money value should includ a currency sign, in this case $. Alternatively, currency sign can be in table header 


Issue: Wrong title for employee update dialog 
Severity: low
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in and edit any employee record
Current behavior: Dialog title is "Add Employee"
Expected behavior: Dialog title is "Update Employee"


Issue: Missing validation messages for Add Employee dialog
Severity: major
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in 
Go to Add Employee dialog
Fill field Dependents: 60
Save dialog
Current behavior: User can't save dialog and there is no validation message
Expected behavior: User is informed about maximum value via validation message on UI


Issue: Default value for Dependents field in Add Employee dialog
Severity: low
Description: It's not clear what Dependents field is (count).
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in 
Go to Add Employee dialog
Current behavior: No default value, user has to fill 0 if there are no Dependents
Note: ideally field should be HTML number value (increase/decrease) + possibility to fill it manually
Expected behavior: Default value is 0, because this field is mandatory


Issue: Dependents field label in Add Employee dialog should contain min and max value (to indicate there is max value)
Severity: low
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in 
Go to Add Employee dialog
Current behavior: No default value, user has to fill 0 if there are no Dependents
Note: ideally field should be <input type="number"> or alternative similar component in UI library
Expected behavior: Default value is 0, because this field is mandatory (in API endpoint isn't)
Note: First Name and Last Name fields should be marked as mandatory


Issue: Add employee success/failure message
Severity: medium
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in 
Go to Add Employee dialog and add Employee details
Current behavior: Employee is added but there is no message on UI about success. That could be an issue if there is failure (e.g. runtime error) or if employee list is big/paginated

Issue: Delete employee success/failure message

Issue: UUID is used as ID colunn on Employee list
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in 
Observe Id column in table
Current behavior: UUID should be used to get employee details. There is no reason to display it as ID in list (makes list harder to read)
Expected behavior: Id should be user friendly (shortened version or different identifier) 

Issue: Employee list is not sorted by any field
Steps to reproduce:
Sign in 
Observe order of employee records
Current behavior: Employee list is not sorted by any column
Expected behavior: Employee list is sorted by default column (e.g Last Name). There should be indication on table header
